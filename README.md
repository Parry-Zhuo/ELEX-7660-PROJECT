This is a project is an LFO Generator. This is a guitar effect pedal accessory that
generates a low frequency oscillator (LFO) control voltage (CV) signal to control external
guitar pedal parameters.

# Features
• Control parameters: LFO rate, depth (amplitude), and waveshape.

• Waveshape ideas: sine, square, triangle, ramp up, ramp down, & random.

• Display active LFO parameters on an OLED display screen.

• LED indicators to show visual representation of LFO rate and on/off state.

• Use encoder knobs to select and change LFO parameters.
